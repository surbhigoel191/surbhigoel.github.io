  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Hello! I am <b>Surbhi</b>. I'm a <u>backend-end developer</u> and a <u>learning enthusiast</u>. I like to describe myself as a <i>Tech-Savvy</i> and <i>Energetic Engineering College Student seeking Growth</i>, i.e., I am crazy about learning anything and everything related to technology (primarily different fields of <u>Computer Science</u>) as well as enjoying my college life.
<br><br>
My first experience with the code was in high school. Though I never had computer science as a subject, I used to listen to my friends' coding experiences now and then. It was when one of my friends told me that she has an intuition that I will love coding, that I became insanely eager to explore the field. I remember spending my vacations in front of laptop searching best teachers online for programming - be it edX, Coursera, Udemy or tens of youtube channels. I remember learning Python, C++ and even ScratchðŸ˜… in just two months. 
<br><br>
  I came to college and was amazed by the coding culture here.  I joined <b>BITS-ACM-W</b> and became <b>Microsoft Student Partner</b> to enhance my coding skills.
