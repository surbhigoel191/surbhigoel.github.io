  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Hello! I am Surbhi. I'm a backend-end developer and a learning enthusiast. I like to describe myself as a Tech-Savvy and Energetic Engineering College Student seeking Growth, i.e., I am crazy about learning anything and everything related to technology (primarily different fields of Computer Science) as well as enjoying my college life.

My first experience with the code was in high school. Though I never had computer science as a subject, I used to listen to my friends' coding experiences now and then. It was when one of my friends told me that she has an intuition that I will love coding, that I became insanely eager to explore the field. I remember spending my vacations in front of laptop searching best teachers online for programming - be it edX, Coursera, Udemy or tens of youtube channels. I remember learning Python, C++ and even ScratchðŸ˜… in just two months. 

I came to college and was amazed by the coding culture here.  I joined BITS-ACM-W became Microsoft Student Partner to enhance my coding skills.

This website is all about me - my projects, achievements, and interests. My contact information is available at the bottom of the page.</p>
